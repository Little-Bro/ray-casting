Ray casting visualisation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting  
You can create a map using my map editor (https://github.com/Little-Bro/better-map-editor) to load your custom map.

I suggest you load the index.html file on a local server : ```python3 -m http.server``` to get around that damned CORS error >:(
